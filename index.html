    Anthony awakes from deep slumber and wanders out of his cell just to find three elevators. Last time he checked, he was roughly 54 kg.  Each elevator is held by different ropes and has different masses, but they are currently held at rest:
    <ul>
      <li>When moving, Elevator 1 has a mass of 980  kg and has a force tension of 9880 N.</li>
      <li>When moving, Elevator 2 has a mass of 1000 kg and has a force tension of 115000 N.</li>
      <li>When moving, Elevator 3 has a mass of 1130 kg and has a force tension of 11000 N.</li>
