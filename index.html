    <br>
    To play the game, you need both the escape-room crate and this website. The website is used to facilitate the introduction and evaluation of clues and solutions. At each panel, read the instructions carefully, and when done, press continue. On some panels, the continue button won't appear until you complete a puzzle or enter a code. It will give you the instructions to move on, and you must complete the steps to proceed.
    <br>
    When you are done reading the directions, please press continue.

    On a hot summer day, Anthony decided to go to a physics themed amusement park to have some fun. All of a sudden, he realized he forgot to finish his physics homework due the next morning! However, getting out is not so easy. The physics amusement park requires various steps that need to be taken in order to leave (it is an educational experience, after all).   
    <br>
    Help get Anthony out of the amusement park as soon as he can!

    Keep track of how much time you are taking to complete the entire mission. <br>
    Try to complete it as fast as possible, as it will determine Anthony's fate! You can also do it at your own pace, and see if you can escape.

    Anthony comes upon his homework dilemma while in the gift shopâ€™s second floor, shopping for Mrs. Smedberg. He needs to get to the first floor. The last time he checked, he was roughly 54 kg.  Each elevator is held by different ropes and has different masses, but right now, they are held at rest:
    <ul>
      <li>When moving, Elevator 1 has a mass of 980 kg and has a force tension of 10350 N.</li>
      <li>When moving, Elevator 2 has a mass of 1000 kg and has a force tension of 12121 N.</li>
      <li>When moving, Elevator 3 has a mass of 1130 kg and has a force tension of 11840 N.</li>
    </ul>

    <div id="elevError" class="alert" style="display: none">

      Incorrect elevator. Please try again!

      Correct! Press 'Continue' to proceed.
