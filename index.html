    <br>
    To play the game, you need both the escape-room crate and this website. The website is used to facilitate the introduction and evaluation of clues and solutions. At each panel, read the instructions carefully, and when done, press continue. On some panels, the continue button won't appear until you complete a puzzle or enter a code. It will give you the instructions to move on, and you must complete the steps to proceed.
    <br>
    When you are done reading the directions, please press continue.

    One day, Anthony was mindlessly walking on the street when he was suddenly strangled by bandits and held captive in a mysterious prison. The bandits keep watch of him in the daytime, but at night the bandits leave to strangle other people. 
    <br>
    Your job is to get Anthony out of the prison before daybreak.

    Keep track of how much time you are taking to complete the entire mission. <br>
    Try to complete it as fast as possible, as it will determine Anthony's fate! You can also do it at your own pace, and see if you can escape.

    Anthony awakes from deep slumber and wanders out of his cell just to find three elevators. Last time he checked, he was roughly 54 kg.  Each elevator is held by different ropes and has different masses, but they are currently held at rest:
    <ul>
      <li>When moving, Elevator 1 has a mass of 980  kg and has a force tension of 9880 N.</li>
      <li>When moving, Elevator 2 has a mass of 1000 kg and has a force tension of 115000 N.</li>
      <li>When moving, Elevator 3 has a mass of 1130 kg and has a force tension of 11000 N.</li>
    </ul>

  <p>After going up the elevator, Anthony encounters a labyrinth. Throughout the labyrinth, there are letters scattered throughout. The letters that are found on the correct route are used to crack the code on the door that leads to his next obstacle. The code is five letters and is all in caps.</p>
