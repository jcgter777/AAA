    One day, Anthony was mindlessly walking on the street when he was suddenly strangled by bandits and held captive in a mysterious prison. The bandits keep watch of him in the daytime, but at night the bandits leave to strangle other people.

    Your job is to get Anthony out of the prison before daybreak.
